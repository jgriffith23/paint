# Paint!

A super simple paint program created in Processing. Click a swatch (or the white space) to choose a color, and use the up and down arrows to change the size of the brush. Thanks to [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/), You can paint a picture [here](https://jgriffith23.github.io/processing/Paint.html).
